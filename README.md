# SmartWatchBase
EEL4924C Senior Design Project: Charger Base for Smart Watch


Creating the Charger Base for a Smart Watch for my Senior Design Project.

Current goal is to make a custom UART and I2C/SPI IP blocks to communicate with watch and display important data on the base,
as well as neopixel drivers to communicate to an individually addressable neopixel strip.

Using DE10-Lite FPGA and Quartus and programming in SystemVerilog.

UART:
115200 baud rate
8 data bits
even/odd parity?
number stop bits?
flow control?
